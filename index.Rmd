# **Data Visualization with GGPlot2 (R) and MatPlotLib (Python)**

Throughout undergraduate, graduate, and professional careers, the two
most widely used statistical languages are Python and R. Both of these
languages have many similarities, but can have very differing syntaxes
and coding implementations.

For this project, it was important to create a cheat sheet so an
individual can easily navigate both languages and transfer knowledge
learned in this course to Python. Therefore, I created a cheat sheet for
GGPlot2 in R, which we learned extensively in class, and MatPlotLib in
Python, which has been the primary visualization package used in my
undergraduate and graduate careers. Both of these packages have their
own cheat sheets, respectively, but they are formatted differently and
it can be hard to parse through both of them to gain the exact line(s)
of code you need when making comparisons or migrating code to another
programming language.

If I had more time, or the next time I create a cheat sheet to navigate
these packages, I would include faceting, subplots, and tick markers. In
addition, I think it would be useful to also have a comparison for
GGPlot2 (R) and Seaborn (Python); or MatPlotLib (Python) and Seaborn
(Python). All three of these packages are heavily used for visualization
and having an easy to access cheat sheet for all of these languages and
packages would make it a lot quicker and easier to transverse any coding
that is trying to be implemented.
